# About Hevy Insights <!-- omit from toc -->

Hevy Insights is a dynamic web application that provides insights and analytics of your workouts and exercises. It visualizes workout data from the Hevy app in a clean dashboard so that you can always keep track of your progress!

In the Hevy app you can only see your stats and progress up to 3 months for free, otherwise you need the paid Hevy PRO membership.
Hevy Insights allows you to log in with your Hevy credentials and fetch your workout data directly from Hevy's API, providing you with detailed visualizations and historical data up to the date of your account creation - no PRO membership required!

# Usage

You can either use Hevy Insights online or run it locally on your machine.

## Hosted Online

Navigate to the hosted version of Hevy Insights at: [https://hevy.kida.one](https://hevy.kida.one)

The latest version is always hosted there.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **Only** your Hevy API token is stored **at your own browser's local storage**. No other data is stored!

## Local Setup

Clone/download the repository and follow these steps:

1. Rename `.env.example` to `.env`.

2. Install the backend and frontend dependencies.

3. **Start the backend** (Terminal 1):

   `python backend/fastapi_server.py`

4. **Start the frontend** (Terminal 2):

   `cd frontend; npm run dev`

5. **Open your browser** and navigate to `http://localhost:5173`

6. **Login** with your Hevy username/email and password

# Future Goals

- Display time on Workout cards like "1h 15m" instead of "75 minutes"
- Better logging
- Replace localStorage with HTTP cookie

## High-Level-Flow

- **index.html**: Browser loads this HTML document first. It defines the root node `<div id="app"></div>` and includes `<script type="module" src="/src/main.ts">`.
- **main.ts**: Entry script runs. Vite serves ES modules and applies HMR in dev. We `createApp(App)`, install `Pinia` and the `Router`, then `mount("#app")`.
- **App.vue**: Root component renders the global shell (fixed sidebar + main). On mount and after each route change it checks `localStorage` for `hevy_auth_token` to toggle sidebar visibility and protect routes.
- **Router**: Resolves the current URL (`/login`, `/dashboard`, `/workouts-card`, `/workouts-list`) and renders the matched view inside `<router-view />`. Auth guards prevent accessing protected routes without a token.
- **View Components**: The matched page component (`Login.vue`, `Dashboard.vue`, `Workouts_Card.vue`, `.....vue`) runs `setup()` and lifecycle hooks (`onMounted`).
- **Pinia Store** (*frontend/src/stores/hevy_cache.ts*): Centralized state with 5‑minute caching for workouts (`workoutsLastFetched`). Exposes actions `fetchUserAccount()`, `fetchWorkouts(force)` and getters like `username`, `hasWorkouts`. Prevents redundant API calls when navigating.
- **Axios Service** (*frontend/src/services/api.ts*): Configures base URL and injects the `auth-token` header via interceptors. All frontend API calls to the backend go through these typed helpers.
- **Backend** (FastAPI): Serves `/api` endpoints. Validates `auth-token` and proxies requests to the official Hevy API. Frontend receives JSON responses and Vue reactivity updates the UI.

### Authentication Flow

1. User logs in via `/api/login` endpoint with Hevy credentials
2. Backend receives `auth_token` from Hevy API
3. Frontend stores token in localStorage
4. Subsequent API requests include token in `auth-token` header
5. Backend uses token to authenticate requests to Hevy API  

## API in Dev vs Prod

- In development, the frontend talks directly to the FastAPI server: the Axios base URL in [frontend/src/services/api.ts](frontend/src/services/api.ts) is `http://localhost:5000/api` when `import.meta.env.PROD` is false.
- In production, the Axios base URL is `/api` (same origin). Requests resolve as `https://your-domain/api/...` and are reverse‑proxied to the backend by Nginx.
- The `import.meta.env.PROD` flag is set automatically by Vite at build time. No extra configuration is required.

### When nginx.conf is used

- The file [frontend/nginx.conf](frontend/nginx.conf) is used when the built frontend is served by Nginx (e.g. on a server with Nginx).
- It performs two critical roles:
   - SPA fallback: routes like `/dashboard` and `/workouts-list` return `index.html` so client‑side routing works.
   - API proxy: requests to `/api/...` are forwarded to the FastAPI backend (e.g., `http://backend:5000`). This keeps a single public origin and avoids CORS in production.
- If your deployment does not use Nginx (e.g., serving static files from a CDN without proxying), ensure your hosting platform supports SPA fallback and adjust the API base accordingly.

### Direct-to-Backend with CORS

- In local development, the frontend dev server runs on `http://localhost:5173` and the backend on `http://localhost:5000`. Because these are different origins, FastAPI enables CORS middleware so the browser can call the backend directly.
- CORS setup in `fastapi_server.py`.
- In production behind Nginx, CORS is not required because the frontend and `/api` share the same origin.
