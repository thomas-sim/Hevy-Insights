### File Descriptions

#### Backend Files

- **`fastapi_server.py`**: FastAPI REST API server with multiple endpoints. Uses Pydantic models for request/response validation and provides auto-generated API docs at `/api/docs`.
- **`hevy_api.py`**: Hevy API module with `HevyClient` class, `HevyConfig` for configuration, and `HevyError` exception. Handles API requests/responses against the official Hevy API.
- **`requirements.txt`**: Python backend package dependencies.

#### Frontend Files

- **`src/router/index.ts`**: Vue Router configuration with navigation guards to protect authenticated routes.
- **`src/services/api.ts`**: Centralized API communication layer using Axios with automatic auth token injection against the Hevy Insights API backend.
- **`src/stores/hevy_cache.ts`**: Pinia store for caching Hevy API data with a 5-minute TTL.
- **`src/views/Dashboard.vue`**: Main dashboard with Chart.js visualizations (volume over time, muscle group distribution) and workout metrics.
- **`src/views/Login.vue`**: Login page with form for Hevy credentials, stores auth token in localStorage.
- **`src/views/Workouts_Card.vue`**: Paginated workout history browser with detailed exercise information (sets, reps, weight, RPE).
- **`src/views/Workouts_List.vue`**: Alternative workout history browser in list design.
- **`src/App.vue`**: Root component with navigation bar and router view.
- **`src/main.ts`**: Vue application initialization and router setup.
- **`src/style.css`**: Global styles for the application.
- **`index.html`**: HTML entry point.
- **`nginx.conf`**: Nginx configuration for serving the built frontend in production mode with SPA fallback and API proxying.
- **`package-lock.json`**: npm package lock file.
- **`package.json`**: Node.js dependencies (Vue 3, Vue Router, Axios, Chart.js, TypeScript, Vite).

### Documentation & Configuration

- **`swagger/swagger.yaml`**: OpenAPI specification documenting all official Hevy API endpoints, request/response schemas, and authentication requirements.
- **`.markdownlint.json`**: Configuration for Markdown linting rules. VS Code extension ID: [DavidAnson.vscode-markdownlint](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=DavidAnson.vscode-markdownlint)
- **`ruff.toml`**: Configuration file for Ruff, Python linter and formatter.

## High-Level-Flow

- **index.html**: Browser loads this HTML document first. It defines the root node `<div id="app"></div>` and includes `<script type="module" src="/src/main.ts">`.
- **main.ts**: Entry script runs. Vite serves ES modules and applies HMR in dev. We `createApp(App)`, install `Pinia` and the `Router`, then `mount("#app")`.
- **App.vue**: Root component renders the global shell (fixed sidebar + main). On mount and after each route change it checks `localStorage` for `hevy_auth_token` to toggle sidebar visibility and protect routes.
- **Router**: Resolves the current URL (`/login`, `/dashboard`, `/workouts-card`, `/workouts-list`) and renders the matched view inside `<router-view />`. Auth guards prevent accessing protected routes without a token.
- **View Components**: The matched page component (`Login.vue`, `Dashboard.vue`, `Workouts_Card.vue`, `Workouts_List.vue`) runs `setup()` and lifecycle hooks (`onMounted`).
   - **Login.vue**: Handles credential input and calls `authService.login()`. On success, stores `auth_token` in `localStorage` and redirects to `/dashboard`.
   - **Dashboard.vue**: Displays various statistics and charts about the user's workouts.
   - **Workouts_Card.vue**: Paginated card view of workouts with stats, description, per-exercise details (sets, reps, weight, RPE) and PR summaries on expanded exercises.
   - **Workouts_List.vue**: Alternative expandable list view with of the user's workouts.
- **Pinia Store** (*frontend/src/stores/hevy_cache.ts*): Centralized state with 5‑minute caching for workouts (`workoutsLastFetched`). Exposes actions `fetchUserAccount()`, `fetchWorkouts(force)` and getters like `username`, `hasWorkouts`. Prevents redundant API calls when navigating.
- **Axios Service** (*frontend/src/services/api.ts*): Configures base URL and injects the `auth-token` header via interceptors. All frontend API calls to the backend go through these typed helpers.
- **Backend** (FastAPI): Serves `/api` endpoints. Validates `auth-token` and proxies requests to the official Hevy API. Frontend receives JSON responses and Vue reactivity updates the UI.

### Authentication Flow

1. User logs in via `/api/login` endpoint with Hevy credentials
2. Backend receives `auth_token` from Hevy API
3. Frontend stores token in localStorage
4. Subsequent API requests include token in `auth-token` header
5. Backend uses token to authenticate requests to Hevy API  

## API in Dev vs Prod

- In development, the frontend talks directly to the FastAPI server: the Axios base URL in [frontend/src/services/api.ts](frontend/src/services/api.ts) is `http://localhost:5000/api` when `import.meta.env.PROD` is false.
- In production, the Axios base URL is `/api` (same origin). Requests resolve as `https://your-domain/api/...` and are reverse‑proxied to the backend by Nginx.
- The `import.meta.env.PROD` flag is set automatically by Vite at build time. No extra configuration is required.

### When `nginx.conf` is used

- The file [frontend/nginx.conf](frontend/nginx.conf) is used when the built frontend is served by Nginx (e.g. on a server with Nginx).
- It performs two critical roles:
   - SPA fallback: routes like `/dashboard` and `/workouts-list` return `index.html` so client‑side routing works.
   - API proxy: requests to `/api/...` are forwarded to the FastAPI backend (e.g., `http://backend:5000`). This keeps a single public origin and avoids CORS in production.
- If your deployment does not use Nginx (e.g., serving static files from a CDN without proxying), ensure your hosting platform supports SPA fallback and adjust the API base accordingly.

### Direct-to-Backend with CORS

- In local development, the frontend dev server runs on `http://localhost:5173` and the backend on `http://localhost:5000`. Because these are different origins, FastAPI enables CORS middleware so the browser can call the backend directly.
- Typical CORS setup (illustrative) in `fastapi_server.py`:

```python
from fastapi.middleware.cors import CORSMiddleware

app.add_middleware(
      CORSMiddleware,
      allow_origins=["http://localhost:5173"],
      allow_credentials=True,
      allow_methods=["*"],
      allow_headers=["*"],
)
```

- In production behind Nginx, CORS is not required because the frontend and `/api` share the same origin.
