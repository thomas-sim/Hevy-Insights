## Translations

To add a new language to Hevy Insights, follow these steps:

1. **Create Language File**

   - Add a new JSON file in `frontend/src/locales/` (e.g., `fr.json` for French). Filename must be in [ISO-639-1 language code](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_639-1) format.
   - Copy the structure from `en.json` and translate all strings
   - Follow the nested structure: `dashboard`, `exercises`, `workouts`, `...`.

   > [!WARNING]
   > You must be able to read the original strings in English to provide accurate translations.

2. **Register Language in Index**
   - Open `frontend/src/locales/index.ts`
   - Import your language file: `import fr from './fr.json';`
   - Add it to the messages object: `messages: { en, de, es, fr }`

3. **Update Settings Component**
   - Open `frontend/src/views/Settings.vue`
   - Add your language to the language selector dropdown
   - Include the flag emoji and native language name

4. **Handle Exercise Localization**
   - Hevy API provides localized exercise titles (e.g. `de_title` and `es_title`)
   - For new languages, add a corresponding field pattern (e.g. `fr_title`)
   - Update these files to check for the new field:
     - `frontend/src/views/Dashboard.vue` - plateauExercises computed property
     - `frontend/src/views/Exercises.vue` - getLocalizedTitle() function
   - The pattern matches the language code: if locale is "fr", check for `fr_title`

5. **Test Thoroughly**
   - Verify all UI strings are translated
   - Check that exercise names display correctly
   - Test language switching in Settings
   - Confirm plateau navigation works with localized exercise names

**Example for French:**

```typescript
// In getLocalizedTitle() or plateauExercises:
if (locale === "fr" && exercise.fr_title) {
  localizedTitle = exercise.fr_title;
}
```

Once you're done commit your changes and create a pull request.

### Setup development environment

#### Backend Setup

1. Create a virtual environment and activate it:

   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   .\venv\Scripts\activate
   ```

2. Install backend dependencies:

   ```bash
   pip install -r backend\requirements.txt
   ```

3. Run the FastAPI backend:

   ```bash
   python backend/fastapi_server.py
   ```

   FastAPI endpoint documentation: `http://localhost:5000/api/docs`

#### Frontend Setup

**Prerequisites**:

- Install [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (v24 or higher)
- Install [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/get-npm) (comes with Node.js, v11 or higher)

1. Navigate to frontend directory and install dependencies:

   ```bash
   cd frontend
   npm install
